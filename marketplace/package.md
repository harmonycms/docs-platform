# Package

## Overview

A package is a piece of reusable code that can be dropped into any application and be used without any tinkering to add functionality to that code. You don't need to know what is happening inside, only what the package's goal. Maybe this package uses another package, in this case this is called a _dependency_.

Public packages can be easily found in the website [Packagist.org](https://packagist.org).
