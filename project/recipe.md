# Recipe

## Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
Generally speaking, a recipe is set of instructions for preparing a particular dish, including a list of the ingredients required.
{% endhint %}

In Harmony Platform, we use the same general idea - a recipe is collection of add-ons \(extensions, packages and/or themes\) used to build a specific fonctionnality. By example, we create a recipe named **Blog** which contains everything needed to build a simple blogging website.

> Recipes are only available in the extension section of the Harmony Marketplace. Recipes are created by the administrators of Harmony Platform.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Be careful**, do not confuse Harmony Recipes and Symfony Flex recipes.
